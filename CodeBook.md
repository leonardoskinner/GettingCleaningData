# Code Book

This code book describes the variables found in 'averages_data.txt'.
This dataset is derived from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" which was originally made avaiable here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

## Identifiers

* `Subject`: it's the ID of the test subject;
* `Activity`: it's the type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken.

## Variables

* `XTrain`, `YTrain`, `XTest`, `YTest`, `SubjectTrain` and `SubjectTest` contain the data from the downloaded files;
* `XData`, `YData` and `SubjectData` merge the previous datasets to further analysis;
* `features` contains the correct names for the `XData` dataset, which are applied to the column names stored in `MeanSTDeviation`, a numeric vector used to extract the desired data;
* A similar approach is taken with activity names through the `activities` variable;
* `AllDATA` merges `XData`, `YData` and `SubjectData` in a big dataset;
* Finally, `averages_data` contains the relevant averages which will be later stored in a `.txt` file. `ddply()` from the plyr package is used to apply `colMeans()` and ease the development.
